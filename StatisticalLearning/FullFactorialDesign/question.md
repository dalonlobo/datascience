# Question

Problem Set :

A. Create a full factorial design for a product with 5 attributes and 2 levels each. Level for each attribute can be labelled 1 and 2.

B. Create an orthogonal design, how many profiles are there?

C. What is the consumers’ willingness to pay for color given the following output of a conjoint analysis. Price has three levels and color has two levels.  Price levels are 50, 100, and 150.  Color levels are Black and White.

The coefficients estimated by caModel function are given below.

Price 50    7.8

Price 100    0.8

Colour Black   1.4


## Correct solution for C

Q<3> - Final Answer is incorrect. Please refer the solution below. 

Given: Price levels are 50, 100, and 150. Color levels are Black and White. Price 50 7.8 Price 100 0.8 Colour Black 1.4 Coefficient for 150 = - 8.6 (For reference : 7.8+0.8 = 8.6) From 150 to move to a price of 50 = 7.8 – (- 8.6) = 16.4 Implies that, willingness to pay Rs.100 results in utility by 16.4  Per Unit of Utility = 100/16.4 = 6.0975609  Approximately = 6.1 Given - Coefficient of Colour for Black = 1.4 Range = 1.4 - (-1.4) = 2.8 Therefore, Willingness to pay = 6.1 * 2.8 Willingness to pay = 17.08 Approximately = Rs.17 is the willingness to pay for colour
