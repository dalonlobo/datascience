# Question


Problem Set

 

    - Load the PIMA Indian Diabetes file into Python DataFrame. The file can be accessed directly from the URL (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/pima-indians-diabetes/pima-indians-diabetes.data (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.) or you may first download it to a local folder and then load it into Python dataframe.  Let us assume the data frame is named  “pima_df.

 

    - It is always a good practice to eye-ball raw data to get a feel of the data in terms of number of structure of the file, number of attributes, types of attributes and a general idea of likely challenges in the dataset. You would notice that it is a comma separated file. There are no column names!. Check the associated folders and find out about each attribute the name. What information is available about the data.

 

 

    - Using univariate analysis check the individual attributes for their basic statistic such as central values, spread, tails etc. What are your observations (any two attributes)?

 

    - Using bivariate analysis check for useful relationships between attributes and attributes and the target class.

 

    - Split the pima_df into training and test set in the ratio of 70:30 (Training:Test).

 

    - Create the model using “entropy” method of reducing the entropy and fit it to training data.

 

    - Test the model on test data and what is the accuracy achieved. Capture the predicted values and do a crosstab.

 

    - Would you get the same result if you recreate the training and test data using random function?

 

    - Use regularization parameters of max_depth, min_sample_leaf to recreate the model. What is the impact on the model accuracy. How does regularization help? Implement the same using Random Forest.

 

    - Next implement the decision tree using Random Forest. What is the optimal number of trees that gives the best result?
