# Data Science

All my work in datascience field will be stored here.
Most of the files in here are jupyter notebooks.

## Instructions to run Jupyter Notebooks:

1. Install conda
2. Create an environment using `conda create`
3. Install all the dependent packages
4. Run `jupyter notebook`

As simple as that. Clone or fork and advance in data science with me.
